:sparkles: **Node App and Tooling** :sparkles:

The plan is to setup server with Node.js and Express.js
and use wepack as the tool for building the front-end.

And webpack-dev-server for development.

***File Structure***

* :file_folder: setup
    * :file_folder: client *--- front-end code*
    * :file_folder: models *--- Mongoose models*
    * :file_folder: routes *--- Routes Express.js*
    * :file_folder: shared *--- shared assets betweenfront-end and back-end*
    * :page_facing_up: server.js

> - [x] setup Webpack
> - [x] setup webpack-dev-server proxy for api
> - [ ] add Less to the project
> - [ ] add Babel to compile es6 and JSX
