** :sparkles: Node App and Tooling :sparkles: **

The plan is create a setup server with Node.js and Express.js
and use Wbepack as the tool for building the front-end.

*** File Structure ***

* :file_folder: setup
    * :file_folder: client *--- front-end code*
    * :file_folder: models *--- Mongoose models*
    * :file_folder: routes *--- API routes Express.js*
    * :file_folder: shared *--- shared assets between* front-end and back-end)
    * :page_with_curl: server.js    *--- express server*

--- TODO ---

- [ ] setup Webpack
- [ ] add Less to the project
- [ ] add Babel to compile es6 and JSX
