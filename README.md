:sparkles: **Node App and Tooling** :sparkles:

The plan is to create a setup server with Node.js and Express.js
and use Wbepack as the tool for building the front-end.

***File Structure***

* :file_folder: setup
    * :file_folder: client *--- front-end code*
    * :file_folder: models *--- Mongoose models*
    * :file_folder: routes *--- API routes Express.js*
    * :file_folder: shared *--- shared assets between* front-end and back-end)
    * :page_facing_up: server.js    *--- express server*

> :pencil: TODO

> - [ ] setup Webpack
> - [ ] add Less to the project
> - [ ] add Babel to compile es6 and JSX
